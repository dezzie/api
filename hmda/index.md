Each year thousands of banks and other financial institutions report data about mortgages to the public as part of the [Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA)](http://www.consumerfinance.gov/hmda/#video). This data is important because:

- It helps show whether lenders are serving the housing needs of their communities;
- It gives public officials insight that helps them make informed decisions about policies; and
- It sheds light on lending patterns that could be discriminatory

The CFPB provides every year of the Loan Application Register (LAR) data since 2007. That adds up to about 15 to 20 million records every year, and we think that you could build something really cool with it.

Look we already made something with it! cf.gov/hmda is something you could make!

##### Get started
We built the API to be as self-documenting as possible, but if you find yourself overwhelmed, we organized this site into four major areas.

- [API basics](basics.html) introduces you to the operations offered by the API.
- [API calls](console/) gives you a hands-on experience of those operations with an interactive console.
- [Query language](queries.html) contains a comprehensive listing of all the API's types, functions, and enumerations.
- [Field reference](fields.html) lists and describes the type of information reported in the LAR.

##### The HMDA API and Qu

<<<<<<< HEAD
HMDA is the CFPB's first dataset to publish using [Qu](http://cfpb.github.io/qu/), an in-progress data platform created to serve public data.

Qu is the first CFPB project built from the beginning on [GitHub](https://github.com/cfpb/), too. If you think you can make the API better–or just want to take a look under the hood–check it out, and learn about how you can host your own datasets or contribute to the project. 
=======
This is the CFPB's first dataset published using [Qu](http://cfpb.github.io/qu/), a framework for data APIs that is still under development. Check out [Qu docs](http://cfpb.github.io/qu/index.html) to learn how this API was built.
